    The Project Application serves the purpose of calculating monthly installments majorly by two loan repayment methods :
    -  **Traditional Compound Interest Method** - In this approach the loanee is entitled to pay monthly interest on the principal amount. At the end of the loan period, he is entitled to pay the principal. However, the loanee can pay the principal according to his convenience along with the interest.
