## **Loan Calculator**

-   The Project is part of C Programming using PBL Approach Course in StepIN Program of GEA.

-   The Project Work is liable to SF ID - 260056.

-   **Brief Introduction** 
    
    The Project Application serves the purpose of calculating monthly installments majorly by two loan repayment methods :

    -   **Traditional Compound Interest Method**    :   In this approach the loanee is entitled to pay monthly interest on the principal amount. At the end of the loan period, he is entitled to pay the principal. However, the loanee can pay the principal according to his convenience along with the interest.

    -   **Amortization Method** :   In this approach, the lender requires the loanee to pay the interest as well as principal in equal monthly installments (EMI). This is widely used method.
